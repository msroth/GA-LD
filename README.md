    This experiment combines the power of a Genetic Algorithm and the Levenshtein Distance calculation to find' a target phrase
    entered by the user.
    
    The input parameters are:
    * Input Phrase: the target phrase for the GA to find.  The default is the first clause from _Gone With the Wind_.
    * Max Generations:  the maximum number of generations the GA will use to find the target phrase.  A generation includes creating
       offspring by crossing the genes of the 'best' parents from the previous generation and some random mutations.
    * Population Size:  the number of idividuals in a generation.  This number does not change from generation to generation.
    * Number of Parents:  the number of \'best\' individuals from the previous generation to sire all of the offspring in the next
       generation.
